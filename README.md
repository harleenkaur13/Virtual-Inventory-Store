# Virtual-Inventory-Store
Project Overview:

The Virtual Store Inventory System is a C++ console application designed to manage a store's inventory efficiently. It showcases core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. The system categorizes products into Electronics, Groceries, and Furniture, providing functionalities for inventory management, sales processing, and transaction reporting.

This project was created as part of a college assignment to demonstrate practical usage of OOP principles in C++.

Key Features:
1. Inventory Management: Allows users to view products in various categories, including their prices, stock levels, and expiry dates.
2. Sales Processing: Enables users to perform sales transactions, ensuring that sufficient stock is available before processing.
3. Transaction Reporting: Generates detailed reports of sales transactions, showing product names, quantities sold, and total prices.
4. File Handling: Loads product data and transactions from text files (store_data.txt, transactions.txt), and saves updates back to files for persistence.

Technologies Used:
1. C++
2. Object-Oriented Programming concepts
3. File handling
4. Data manipulation.

File Structure:
1. Main.cpp: The core program implementing inventory, sales, and report generation functionalities.
2. store_data.txt: Stores product information categorized by Electronics, Groceries, and Furniture.
3. transactions.txt: Logs all sales transactions for record-keeping.

How to Run:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run Main.cpp using any C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio).
3. Interact with the system via the console to view the inventory, make sales, and generate transaction reports.
